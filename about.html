            Hello, I am currently working on getting a professional certificate in Front-End Web Development. I am learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I started taking coding more seriously within the last couple months.
            Before starting this journey, I was exposed to this field when I took an interest in Grand Theft Auto V's online servers (FiveM). I spent a lot of time trying to learn lua language in order to edit the scripts or mods the game could use.
            After about half a year to a full year of doing that, I got pretty comfortable editing the code and trouhbleshooting it on my own. Now Im looking to expand my knowledge in the coding world.
